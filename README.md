🕯 Overview

🜸 Base Deck — Shared Starting Deck

Each Spellweaver begins with the same core: 10 cards focused on the push-and-pull between casting for power or discarding for Aether.

🌫 Aetherflow — Shared Market

The Aetherflow is a dynamic shared market. Cards drift left each turn, and new cards enter from the right.
Costs follow the pattern (4, 3, 2, 2, 2) — creating natural tension between seizing early value or waiting for lower prices.
