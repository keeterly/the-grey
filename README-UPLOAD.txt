The Grey — Mobile Optimizations PLUS (v2.1)
===========================================

Adds:
- Rotate overlay on phones in portrait
- Compact mode that shrinks AI/slots/Aetherflow but keeps hand cards full size
- Compact Toggle in HUD (left): cycles Auto → On → Off and remembers your choice
- Tighter paddings & ultra-small (≤420px) tweaks to avoid side scroll

Files (upload to branch v2.1):
- assets/css/acceptance.safe.css
- assets/js/boot-debug.js

Install:
1) In GitHub → switch to v2.1 branch
2) Add file → Upload files and drop in both files above (keep exact paths)
3) Commit, then hard refresh (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R)

Verify:
- Version badge shows: "The Grey — v2.3.9-acceptanceP1-safe-v14"
- In portrait (phone), overlay prompts to rotate; compact layout active
- Use the new ⇆ button in HUD (left) to set Auto / On / Off

If your Pages site serves a different branch:
- Repeat the upload on that branch or change Settings → Pages → Source to v2.1.
